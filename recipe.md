This is the Recipe for making Maggi in the lowest time possible (not 2 minutes probably ;))

1. Take water in a saucepan as watery as you want it to be.

Let it boil for some time to make it hot.

2. Once, the water is hot enough, put 1-2 packets of Maggi depending on the amount of water you put.
3. Put the spices depending on how many packets you put (if 1 packet then put 1 sachet and so on).
4. Mix it with a spoon or any utensil until it gets mixed well.
5. Turn the stove off and leave it covered with a lid for 4-5 minutes.

You're done!!!!!! Enjoy your Maggi!
